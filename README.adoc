= Terraform config to provision AWS IAM credentials for installing OpenShift in Manual Credentials Mode

Perform the usual Terraform steps:
[source]
----
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
----

Once completed, you can check the AWS IAM console for the created IAM policies and users.

These config also generates a couple of files locally, under `generated-files` folder. In this folder, you'll find the `installer-credentials` file. This is the AWS credentials file for openshift installer. 

There are also yaml files under `generated-files/secrets` folder that contains k8s yamls that should be applied to openshift cluster as part of cluster installation. 

With the resources provisioned, install OpenShift (in Manual credentials mode) using the instructions from my article https://naikoob.github.io/blog/2021/04/20/manual-credentials-mode.html[here].
